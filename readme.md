**Owlet's Embrace** is an action exploration platformer, blending fast paced grappling hook manouvers with combat and emotional discovery.

I'm making the game from scratch for the *Playdate* in C. I only upload the source code and keep lib files and assets local. The only dependencies are the PlaydateSDK in the Playdate backend and SDL in the SDL backend. The code is made to work, probably contains bugs and doesn't contain any documentation besides what I deem necessary for myself.
