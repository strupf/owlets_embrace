gameplay
* selectable items/abilities (using the crank to cycle through?)
* path movement for moving platforms
    * linear, pingpong, circular
    * load path from map
* talkable NPCs
* enemies
    * damage/health mechanic
    * dying? quick respawn vs savepoints?
* static spikes - as objects or tiles?
* implement low and high slopes, including rope logic


loading
* autotiling for low and high slopes

graphics
* current selected item frame
* rope
    * better rendering (textured thick rope?)
    * "hanging" animation of rope when not stretched
* animated background art/layer/particles

textbox
* typewriter noises
* choice prompt in a dialogue

bugs
* rope: removal of a point during tighten can result in three
    collinear points which span a degenerate triangle -> in that
    case delete the middle point, too
? graphics: make textures without transparency mask work for sprites
