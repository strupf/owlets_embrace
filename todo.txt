general
* generate placeholder assets or workaround so that the game is still executable
  -> error message instead of crashing silently without a debugger

gameplay
* rope improvement
* rope as a dedicated usable item
* better character controls
* implement a hook aiming mechanic
* make moving solids interact with the rope

loading
* autotiling for low and high slopes
* object loading from map file

graphics
* current selected item frame
* better rope rendering (textured thick rope)

bugs
* rope: removal of a point during tighten can result in three
    collinear points which span a degenerate triangle -> in that
    case delete the middle point, too
* triple check point on line check routines
