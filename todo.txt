general
* generate placeholder assets or workaround so that the game is still executable
  -> error message instead of crashing silently without a debugger

gameplay
* better character controls
* rope
    * rope as a dedicated usable item
* path movement for moving platforms
    * linear, pingpong, circular
    * load path from map


loading
* autotiling for low and high slopes

graphics
* current selected item frame
* rope
    * better rendering (textured thick rope?)
    * "hanging" of rope when not stretched


textbox
* typewriter noises

bugs
* rope: removal of a point during tighten can result in three
    collinear points which span a degenerate triangle -> in that
    case delete the middle point, too
